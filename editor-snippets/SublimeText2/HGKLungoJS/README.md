# LungoJS Plugin for Sublime Text 2

#### Created by Jon Arrien (jon.arrien@hegaka.com)

##USAGE

- Copy HGKLungoJS to Package Folder.
- Open existing html file or create a new one.
- Select View --> Syntax --> LungoJS
- Type anything starting with 'lng' and a list of snippets should appear. (Must have autocompletion enabled)

INFO: If you don't know where is Package Folder, go to: 
Preferences-->Browse Packages in Sublime Text 2

##OTHERS 

Don't hesitate to ask me whatever you want.

I recommend using a dropbox account and make symbolic links to sublime folders. That way you can have the same settings on all your computers.
